# PointilistNet

Applying novel ideas to the MNIST dataset.

## Layout

- `pointilist` - the common library code that provides some helpers
- `experiments` - free for all space that contains ideas in a place to share
- `data` - put downloaded data here (which is ignored).

## Setup
- Use `pointilist.env` for constants
- launch `jupyter` from the top-level (i.e. same dir as this README)
- add this directory to your python path `export PYTHONPATH=$PWD`
